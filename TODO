* Security! SessionID MUST be sanitized before trusting it blindly.
* Security! Helpers used in Unit tests must not be available to
  students. Use different classpaths for compiling and executing?
* Use CSS.
* More sane formatting of tester and compiler output
* Compiler infrastructure must be pluggable (OOP code needed)
* Code printing with line numbers and highlights.
* Store result in session, save to moodle on Grade.
* Only re-compile, when compile button was selected.
* Error testing.
  - Compiler killed
  - Unit test killed
  - QE temporariliy down
* Grey out grade button if code has been never compiled.
* Selenium: implement test sanitizer:
  filter out bogus <link rel="selenium.base" href="This Crap Here!" /> elements
  filter out bogus Open commands
* Selenium: uurida mis nuss on testi tulemuste kuvamisel täpitähtedega
* Do not re-send resources that are already present if they haven't changed
* Investigate possible support for adaptive Quiz-es.
* Investigate re-submitting logic - maybe possible when quiz runs in
  "adaptive" mode.
* Fix opaque's file.php to send correct filename.
* Fix opaque to not re-open sessions on quiz page change
* SeleniumEngine 254. If out.html can't be read, utter error message
  and Do NOT decrement attempt count.
* JUnitEngine - try do distinguish between javac execution error and
  compile error. As well as try to distinguish between Unit test error
  and it's execution error.
